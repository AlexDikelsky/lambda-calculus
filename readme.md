# λ-Calculus 

This is an implementation of the untyped λ-calculus[1] in Rust. The λ-calculus 
is a model for computation that is based on mathematical logic.
This implementation represents abstractions, 
applications, and variables in an enum. Rust's enums allow associated types[2],
meaning that applications form a binary tree-like structure.

This program uses lalrpop to parse lambda terms. It is based off of the
implementation used in "Types and Programming Languages" [3], but uses symbolic
on-the-fly renaming rather than De Brujin indices.
